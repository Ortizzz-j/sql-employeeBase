# sql-employeeBase

## Purpose

to make it easy for an employer to view their employees and there roles in there departments. The other purpose is to use and get exposure to using sql and combining it with javascript so that we can create delete and view the data base dynamically in the command line.

## Improvements Needed

currently need to make it so that the tables join when one is clicked after the other and also to be able to add an employee, role, or department.

## Lesson Learned

sql is very unforgiving in terms of mistakes and will through an error for anything that is out of place or not expected.
